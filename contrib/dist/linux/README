===========================================================================

The buildrpm.sh script takes a single argument -- a filename pointing
to an Open MPI tarball (may be either .gz or .bz2).  It will create
one or more RPMs from this tarball:

1. Source RPM
2. "All in one" RPM, where all of Open MPI is put into a single RPM.
3. "Multiple" RPM, where Open MPI is split into several sub-package
   RPMs:
   - openmpi-runtime
   - openmpi-devel
   - openmpi-docs (not currently generated because we have no docs; to
     be rectified soon!)

The prefix, target architecture, and choice of RPM(s) to build are all
currently hard-coded in the beginning of the buildrpm.sh script.

Alternatively, you can build directly from the openmpi.spec spec file
or SRPM directly.  The following options are permissable on the
"rpmbuild" command line via the --define option (listed
alphabetically):

- build_all_in_one_rpm: 0 or 1 (default: 1)
  If 1 (the default), make a single RPM that contains all of the Open
  MPI software.  If 0, build multiple sub-package RPMs to split up the
  Open MPI code into separate functional areas.  See the spec file for
  the exact division and subpackage definitions.

- build_debuginfo_rpm: 0 or 1 (default: 0)
  If 1, builds a corresponding debuginfo rpm.

- cflags: string (default: supplied by rpmbuild: $RPM_OPT_FLAGS)
  CFLAGS value to use

- configure_options: string (default: "")
  String to pass directly to the ./configure script.

- cxxflags: string (default: supplied by rpmbuild: $RPM_OPT_FLAGS)
  CXXFLAGS value to use

- f77flags: string (default: supplied by rpmbuild: $RPM_OPT_FLAGS)
  F77FLAGS value to use

- fcflags: string (default: supplied by rpmbuild: $RPM_OPT_FLAGS)
  F90FLAGS value to use

- install_in_opt: 0 or 1 (default: 0)
  If 1, use a prefix of /opt/openmpi/<version>-<release>.

- install_modulefile: 0 or 1 (default: 0)
  If 1, then install a modulefile in
  %{modulefile_path}/%{modulefile_subdir}/%{modulefile_name}

- install_shell_scripts: 0 or 1 (default: 0)
  If 1, then install shell environment setup scripts in 
  %{shell_scripts_path}/%{shell_scripts_basename}.[sh|csh]

- leave_build_root: 0 or 1 (default: 0)
  In certain cases (such as the OFED installer), it is necessary to
  *not* remove the RPM_BUILD_ROOT before building.  The default is 0,
  because most users won't need this.

- mflags: string (default: "")
  Flags to pass to the "make" [default] target during %build

- mflags_install: string (default: "")
  Flags to pass to the "make install" target during %install

- modulefile_name: string (default: "%{version}")
  Defaults to %{version}

- modulefile_path: string (default: "/etc/modulefiles")
  Defaults to /etc/modulefiles

- modulefile_subdir: string (default: "openmpi")
  Defaults to openmpi

- modules_rpm_name: string ("modules")
  Name of the environment modules RPM to "require".

- munge_build_into_install: 0 or 1 (default: 0)
  In certain cases (such as the OFED installer on SuSE Linux), the
  %build macro unconditionally removes the entire RPM_BUILD_ROOT
  before starting.  This can be bad when building the RPM depends on
  other things that are already in the RPM_BUILD_ROOT.  This option
  pushes the entire "build" procedure down into the %install macro,
  thereby avoiding the problem.  Most users should leave this option
  as the default (0) so that %build and %install are separate phases.

- name: string (default "openmpi")
  If set, used as the name of the RPM (useful if you want to add a
  compiler name -- or some other qualifier -- to the RPM name).

- _packager: string (default: supplied by rpmbuild)
  Name of the packager

- _prefix (etc.): string (default: supplied by rpmbuild)
  Prefix directory (all other standard names are also supported, such
  as _libdir, _sysconfdir, _includedir, etc.).

- shell_scripts_basename: string (default: "mpivars")
  Defaults to installing mpivars.sh and mpivars.csh

- shell_scripts_path: string (default: "%{_bindir}")
  Defaults to the $bindir where OMPI is installed

- use_check_files: 0 or 1 (default: 1)
  In certain cases (such as the OFED installer), it is necessary to
  disable the check for unpackaged files because the RPM_BUILD_ROOT
  will intentionally contain files that are outside of the Open MPI
  RPM.  The default is 1 because most users will be building the Open
  MPI RPM individually, not in conjunction with other packages
  simultaneously in the RPM_BUILD_ROOT.

- _vendor: string (default: supplied by rpmbuild)
  Name of the vendor
