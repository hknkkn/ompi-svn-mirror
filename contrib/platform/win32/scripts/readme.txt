This folder contains the batch files for building Open MPI releases.

Using the scripts is very straightforward, just specify the path to the ompi source as the first (only) parameter, e.g.:
                 build_release_shared_64.bat OpenMPI/openmpi-1.7

In the script, one may have to modify the cwd variable to a proper place, which is the absolute working path.

The ompi icons may be also put in the same directory, so the generated installers will look better.
