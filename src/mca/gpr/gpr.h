 * Begin recording a compound command.
 * Normally, the registry executes each command as it is called. This, however, can result
 * in an undesirable amount of network traffic. To reduce the traffic, this command allows
 * the user to aggregate a set of registry commands - in any combination of put, get, index,
 * or any other command - to be executed via a single communication to the registry.
 *
 * While recording, all registry commands are stored in a buffer instead of being immediately
 * executed. Thus, commands that retrieve information (e.g., "get") will return a NULL
 * during recording. Values from these commands will be returned when the compound
 * command is actually executed.
 *
 * The process of recording a compound command is thread safe. Threads attempting to
 * record commands are held on a lock until given access in their turn.

/* Deliver a notify message.
 * The registry generates notify messages whenever a subscription or synchro is fired. Normally,
 * this happens completely "under the covers" - i.e., the notification process is transparent
 * to the rest of the system, with the message simply delivered to the specified callback function.
 * However, there are two circumstances when the system needs to explicitly deliver a notify
 * message - namely, during startup and shutdown. In these two cases, a special message is
 * "xcast" to all processes, with each process receiving the identical message. In order to
 * ensure that the correct data gets to each subsystem, the message must be disassembled and
 * the appropriate callback function called.
 *
 * This, unfortunately, means that the decoder must explicitly call the message notification
 * subsystem in order to find the callback function. Alternatively, the entire startup/shutdown
 * logic could be buried in the registry, but this violates the design philosophy of the registry
 * acting solely as a publish/subscribe-based cache memory - it should not contain logic pertinent
 * to any usage of that memory.
 *
 * This function provides the necessary "hook" for an external program to request delivery of
 * a message via the publish/subscribe's notify mechanism.
 *
 * @param state The notify action associated with the message. Currently, only two values are
 * supported: ORTE_REGISTRY_NOTIFY_ON_STARTUP and ORTE_REGISTRY_NOTIFY_ON_SHUTDOWN. The function
 * will search the notification system for all requests that match this state and also match
 * the segment name specified in the message itself. Each of the matching requests will be
 * called with the message.
 *
 * @param message The message to be delivered.
 *
 * @retval ORTE_SUCCESS Operation was successfully completed.
 * @retval ORTE_ERROR(s) Operation failed, returning the provided error code.
 *
 * @code
 * status_code = orte_gpr.deliver_notify_msg(state, message);
