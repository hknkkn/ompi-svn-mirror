[invalid mem_alloc_policy]
WARNING: An invalid value was given for the
hwloc_base_general_alloc_policy MCA parameter.  This MCA parameter
determines the policy used for general memory allocations.  Note that
this parameter *only* has effect when MPI processes are bound to
specific processors.

The value provided was:

  Local host: %s
  PID:        %d
  Value:      %s

Valid values are:

  none:         no memory binding policy is enforced
  local_only:   fail an allocation if it cannot be placed entirely on
                the local NUMA node

Your job will now abort.
#
[invalid mem_bind_failure_action]
WARNING: An invalid value was given for the
hwloc_base_mem_bind_failure_action MCA parameter.  This MCA parameter
determines what happens when memory fails to bind to a specific
locale.  Note that this parameter *only* has effect when MPI processes
are bound to specific processors.

The value provided was:

  Local host: %s
  PID:        %d
  Value:      %s

Valid values are:

  warn:       print a warning, but continue the job
  error:      print a warning and abort the job

Your job will now abort.
