[orte-rmaps-lama:multi-apps-and-zero-np]
RMAPS found multiple applications to be launched, with at least one that failed
to specify the number of processes to execute. When specifying multiple
applications, you must specify how many processes of each to launch via the
-np argument.

[orte-rmaps-lama:oversubscribe]
RMaps LAMA detected oversubscription after mapping %d of %d processes.
Since you have asked not to oversubscribe the resources the job will not
be launched. If you would instead like to oversubscribe the resources
try using the --oversubscribe option to mpirun.

[orte-rmaps-lama:no-resources-available]
RMaps LAMA detected that there are not enough resources to map the
remainder of the job. Check the command line options, and the number of
nodes allocated to this job.
